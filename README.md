# Brute-Force Matching using ORB descriptors
---
*Developer: Derek Santos*

### About:

Note that this program uses C++ 14 experimental library to detect file existence.

The program will take a base image and compare key features against a target image.

### Technologies

The program was written in C++ 14 and uses OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) 3.4.0 as the image processing library.

### Purpose:

The purpose of the program was to get familiar with OpenCV's Brute-Force matching and ORB descriptors. I plan on using these two concepts within a bigger project, that will hopefully lead into machine learning in the future.
